# MetaBot Call Remote Service

Delegate one task to a remote MetaBot over MetaWeb while preserving the validated order, spend-cap, and trace semantics.

## Host Adapter

{{HOST_SKILLPACK_METADATA}}

## Routing

{{SYSTEM_ROUTING}}

## Command

Prepare a request file:

```json
{
  "request": {
    "servicePinId": "service-pin-id",
    "providerGlobalMetaId": "gm-provider",
    "providerDaemonBaseUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:4827",
    "userTask": "tell me tomorrow's fortune",
    "taskContext": "user asked for tomorrow fortune reading",
    "spendCap": {
      "amount": "0.00005",
      "currency": "SPACE"
    }
  }
}
```

Then call:

```bash
{{METABOT_CLI}} services call --request-file request.json
```

## Confirmation Contract

{{CONFIRMATION_CONTRACT}}

## Demo Transport

- If a demo-time `providerDaemonBaseUrl` is available from the service directory or local yellow-pages flow, include it in the request.
- In that mode, `{{METABOT_CLI}} services call` performs the real caller-to-provider daemon round-trip instead of stopping at a local ready-plan.
- If no provider daemon URL is available yet, the command still returns the validated local plan/trace envelope so the host can pause or hand off cleanly.

## Result Handling

- `success`: continue with the returned trace id and external conversation linkage.
- If `responseText` is present, treat it as the remote MetaBot's returned result and surface it directly to the human.
- If provider-side trace paths are present, keep them for demo evidence and follow-up inspection.
- `failed`: stop and surface the failure code without pretending the remote task ran.
- `manual_action_required`: hand off to the returned local UI URL and pause automation.
